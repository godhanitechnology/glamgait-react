              Customer Testimonials and Reviews: We post customer testimonials
              and reviews on our web site which may contain personally
              identifiable information. We do obtain the customer’s consent via
              email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along
              with their testimonial. When a customer chooses to post a review
              of a product, we ask for a nickname and location. If you would
              like to request to have your testimonial or review removed from
              our site you may email us.
