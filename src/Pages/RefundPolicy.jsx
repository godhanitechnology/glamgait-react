                We always strive hard to provide the best experience to our
                customers. However, we have noticed that few accounts abuse our
                liberal returns policy and these accounts typically return most
                of the items bought or choose to not accept COD shipments.
                Hence, our regular customers are deprived of the opportunity to
                buy these items. To protect the rights of our customers, we
                reserve the right to collect shipping charge of Rs.99 for all
                orders and disable cash on delivery option for accounts which
                have high percentage of returns.

              You may contact our Customer Care within 5 calendar days of having
              received the product and request a return/exchange, subject to the
              above mentioned terms and conditions. We will arrange for the
              products to be collected from the delivery address through courier
              and shall process the return/exchange subject to receipt of the
              products at our location in unused condition and in its original
              packaging along with the invoice, failing which return/exchange
              may not be possible.
